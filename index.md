**Delivering Bad News (DBN)**

_You only get one chance to get this right._

##My failures

1. Abnormal chest CT Me: "The CT shows a large mass. We don’t know what it is.
   It could just be an infection but it could be something else like a
   malignancy. I would not get all upset as right now we just dont know what it
   is."

2. Ruptured AAA Me: "The CT shows that your aneurysm has ruptured and that is
   why your blood pressure and blood levels are so low. I called the vascular
   surgeon and he says that surgery is too risky."

Patient: "You’re saying, I’m toast. How long do have? When will I die?"

Me: "Today."

3. Patient with complete bowel obstruction Patient : "No one will even tell me
   how long I have!"

Me: "One month."

Patient: "Oh!"

3. Calling family of patient who died after a code Me: "They passed."

Me: "They lost their pulse and we called a code. We did everything we could but
they didn’t make it."

##What is Bad News

Most docs just think of cancer or immediate life threatening illness as ‘bad
news’ but any threat to a patient’s ‘self identity’ is bad news to them.

Bad news is "any news that adversely and seriously affects an individual’s view
of his or her future"
([Buckman 1984](http://endoflife.stanford.edu/M19_communic/Refs_buckman.htm#Buckman1984))

## Types of Bad News:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Life-limiting serious illnesses</td>
    <td>cancer,
hematological malignancies,
advanced heart disease of any etiology,
advanced lung disease of any etiology,
advanced neurological disease of any etiology,
advanced renal disease of any etiology,
advanced liver disease of any etiology and
Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Life-altering chronic illnesses</td>
    <td>diabetes,
hypertension,
rheumatologic illnesses (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, fibromyalgia),
chronic heart failure,
coronary heart disease,
cirrhosis, chronic renal failure,
chronic lung diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

##Background

Delivering bad news is stressful, both all parties involved in the conversation:
patients, families, and physicians1.

1998 American Society of Clinical Oncology (400 Oncologists: most delivered
5-20X/ month)

* <5% any training in delivering bad news

* 74% no specific approach

* > 90% most difficult aspect was dealing with emotions

There is evidence that physicians do not get better at DBN with time.

##Three Styles of DBN2

"To look at what happened to doctors when they gave bad news, professor Stewart
Dunn and his team monitored heartbeat consultants and registrar's interactions
with a professional actor playing a woman finding out she had lost her husband.
"From even before the he comes through the door the doctor's heartbeats when up
and average of 35 beats at baseline, which underlies how stressful the situation
is. And there is no difference between consultants and registrars, which suggest
this doesn't get any less stressful with experience."

BLUNT: The blunt style is characterized by providers delivering the news within
the 30 seconds of the interaction.

FORECASTING: A stage delivery of the news within the first 2 minutes.

STALLING: Delaying this serious news for more than 2 minutes. This avoidance
style relies on the news recipient reaching a conclusion about event, without
the doctor explicitly conveying the news.

**_Be aware that most of the reasons for bad delivery by the news-giver is
anticipation of the emotions of the news-receiver. (medical jargon, stalling,
overly positive prognosis)_**

_The Solution to The Problem of Delivering Bad News: HAVE A PLAN_

##SPIKES - The Six-Step Protocol for Delivering Bad News

* "A strategy not a script"- includes most important elements of DBN.

* Adaptable to family meetings and GOC discussions

###S.P.I.K.E.S

* STEP 1: SETTING UP the Interview

\** Prepare

\** Privacy

\** Involve significant others

\** Sit down

\** Look attentive and calm

\** Listening mode

\** Availability

* STEP 2: Assessing the Patient’s PERCEPTION ** "Before you tell, ask" ** "What
  have the other doctor's told you about..." \** NOT A QUIZ "What is your
  understanding?"

* STEP 3: Obtaining the Patient’s INVITATION

* STEP 4: Giving KNOWLEDGE and Information to the Patient

* STEP 5: Addressing the Patient’s EMOTIONS with empathic responses

* STEP 6: Strategy and Summary

Strategy and Summary(S)

##Example First ask:

You have to determine what the patient knows about their current situation
before starting a discussion about the next phase.

_"What is your understanding of your illness?"_

Warning shot:

Warn them about the bad news to come _" I am afraid I have some bad news for
you”_

**Pause:** Give them a moment to compose themselves and get ready to hear the
news

Deliver the news:

* Use short sentences.

* Make it non technical to the extent possible.

* Use the words – "Cancer," "AIDS," "Death" as appropriate

_" As you may recall, we did a CT scan of your lungs. The results show that the
cancer has come back”_

Sympathetic silence:

* Give them time to process the bad news. Don’t rush into the next steps

* After giving this news, stay quiet for at least 10-15 seconds-resist the urge
  to tell the patient how to feel.

* Allow them to assimilate the information

Answering questions:

* Be prepared to repeat the information: sometimes the impact of the information
  is so great that patients may want to hear it a second time

* Answer questions kindly and honestly

* If you do not know the answers please state so

* If the next step is uncertain state so.

Assure non-abandonment:

* Assure the patient that you will be willing and available to support them on
  an ongoing basis.

_" I am here to support you. I will still be your doctor no matter what
happens”_

Follow up:

* Make clear plans for follow up.

* Please write our instructions briefly and clearly and hand it to them

* Give them guideline how about how best to get in touch with you/designee

De-brief and self-reflection:

* Be aware that your colleagues (trainees, multi disciplinary clinicians) often
  have strong reactions to these situations. Be sure to check in with them.

* Be aware of your own responses. Be kind to yourself.

    <td>Phraseology : Do’s and Don’ts
What not to say
What to say
"I know exactly how you feel."
Sweeping statements that are not grounded in personal or professional experiences are hard to believe.
“My past experience with many patients in your situation has taught me that you must be in distress right now.”
“I can imagine how upset you must be.”
“You have failed chemotherapy.”
“You have failed the radiation therapy.”
This implies that it is the patient’s fault that the therapies are not working.
“Unfortunately, the __________ chemotherapy / radiotherapy does not seem to be working very well for you.”
“There is nothing else we can do.”
“Looks like the ________ is not working very well. However, you can be sure that we will do everything in our power to make sure that you won’t suffer.”
“There is nothing more that can be done. I am going to refer you to hospice.”
“Doctor: As we discussed during your last clinic visit, it looks like the ________ treatment we tried is not working. In addition, you are having a lot of side effects as well. So we have to stop the ________medication.
Patient: What do we do next, doc?
Doctor: At this time, I do not have other viable medications that I can offer to you”
Patient: …..
Doctor: Meantime, you are having a lot of pain and other problematic symptoms. So, I would like to refer you to hospice. Hospice professionals have a lot of expertise in treating symptoms and increasing comfort and quality of life. They will help you by managing your ________________ (pain, nausea, etc).

**Pitfalls/Common Barriers to Good Communication **

• Giving pathophysiology lectures.

• Ignoring the context of the communication encounter.

• Not finding out the patient’s information needs.

• Launching into your agenda first without negotiating the focus of the
interview.

• Offering reassurance prematurely.

NURSE statements for articulating empathy\*

2 COPING STYLES:

Psychologists have identified two main coping styles: monitors and blunters.
Patients who use problem-focused coping have been termed "monitors," who
typically seek information to help them manage. Monitors are very interested in
planning ahead, and are highly problem focused. In particular, monitors may find
that as their cancer progresses beyond the possibility of cure, they may hit a
wall in seeking information. With these patients, it may be helpful to limit or
contain their information seeking and gently shift them towards acknowledging
their emotions (NURSE). Patients who use emotion-focused coping are termed
“blunters,” who tend to cope by avoiding information, distancing themselves, and
engaging in denial of their situation. Blunters often avoid practical planning,
which almost ensures that others will be making decisions for them at the end of
their lives. With these patients, it may be necessary to contain their emotions
and shift them towards information and practical planning using “ask-tellask.”
Although these patients are said to be emotion-focused, they may not be ready to
go beyond denial with you until they have developed a very high level of trust.
It may be counterproductive to use NURSE repeatedly in the early stages of your
relationship with a blunter.

Pearls

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>

Delivering bad news is very stressful for clinicians with the after effects
lasting for hours to days. Competence is a great stress reliever. The clinician
who is adequately trained in communication skills is more likely to break bad
news both sensitively and efficiently. Hearing bad news is very stressful and
distressing to patients. Patients with previous history of mental illness,
patients with poor social and financial support systems are especially
vulnerable to the after effects of bad news. Ask before you tell: First ask the
patient "What is your understanding of your illness?" Deliver the bad news in
simple clear sentences. Avoid jargon. Arrange for follow-up care. Debrief your
staff and allow time for self-reflection.
