  Talking to a non-decision maker
    - Definitions
      -- Surrogate decision maker
      -- Health care proxy defined in living will, advance directives
      -- Power of attorney
          -- May be HCPOA
          -- May only be POA and limited to financial decisions
    - Itâ€™s not the oldest
  
  <details>
  <summary>More info</summary>
  POA papers are typically prepared legally through a law office and may/may not include HC POA (must read to clarify)
   Living wills identify a healthcare proxy. If using the HH Advanced Directives packet, only 2 witnesses required, not notary.
   If we are recognizing, decision maker as HC POA or HC proxy, we should make every attempt to get paperwork on chart if not in Cerner.
   If letting NOK, act as medical surrogate, we should use the CERTIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE DECISION SURROGATE (PULSE page, forms) at least for compassionate extubation.
   If none of the above and no relatives, need case mgt to work on expedited guardianship. Guardianship (power over the person) vs. Conservatorship (power over the purse).
