# Delivering Bad News (DBN)

_You only get one chance to get this right._

## My failures

1. Abnormal chest CT

* Me: "The CT shows a large mass. We don‚Äôt know what it is. It could just be an
  infection but it could be something else like a malignancy. I would not get
  all upset as right now we just dont know what it is."

2. Ruptured AAA
   * Me: "The CT shows that your aneurysm has ruptured and that isnwhy your
     blood pressure and blood levels are so low. I called the vascular surgeon
     and he says that surgery is too risky."

* Patient: "You‚Äôre saying, I‚Äôm toast. How long do have? When will I die?"

* Me: "Today."

3. Patient with complete bowel obstruction

* Patient: "No one will even tell me how long I have!"

* Me: "One month."

* Patient: "Oh!"

3. Calling family of patient who died after a code

* Me: "They passed."

* Me: "They lost their pulse and we called a code. We did everything we could
  but they didn‚Äôt make it."

## What is Bad News

Most docs just think of cancer or immediate life threatening illness as ‚Äòbad
news‚Äô but any threat to a patient‚Äôs ‚Äòself identity‚Äô is bad news to them.

Bad news is "any news that adversely and seriously affects an individual‚Äôs view
of his or her future"
([Buckman 1984](http://endoflife.stanford.edu/M19_communic/Refs_buckman.htm#Buckman1984))

## Types of Bad News:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Life-limiting serious illnesses</td>
    <td>cancer,
hematological malignancies,
advanced heart disease of any etiology,
advanced lung disease of any etiology,
advanced neurological disease of any etiology,
advanced renal disease of any etiology,
advanced liver disease of any etiology and
Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Life-altering chronic illnesses</td>
    <td>diabetes,
hypertension,
rheumatologic illnesses (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, fibromyalgia),
chronic heart failure,
coronary heart disease,
cirrhosis, chronic renal failure,
chronic lung diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Background

Delivering bad news is stressful, both all parties involved in the conversation:
patients, families, and physicians1.

1998 American Society of Clinical Oncology (400 Oncologists: most delivered
5-20X/ month)

* <5% any training in delivering bad news

* 74% no specific approach

* ~90% most difficult aspect was dealing with emotions

There is evidence that physicians do not get better at DBN with time.

_Be aware that most of the reasons for bad delivery by the news-giver is
anticipation of the emotions of the news-receiver. (medical jargon, stalling,
overly positive prognosis)_

_The Solution to The Problem of Delivering Bad News: HAVE A PLAN_

## SPIKES - The Six-Step Protocol for Delivering Bad News

* "A strategy not a script"- includes most important elements of DBN.

* Adaptable to family meetings and GOC discussions

### S.P.I.K.E.S

* STEP 1: SETTING UP the Interview

  * Prepare
  * Privacy
  * Involve significant others
  * Sit down
  * Look attentive and calm
  * Listening mode
  * Availability

* STEP 2: Assessing the Patient‚Äôs PERCEPTION

  * Before you tell, ask
  * "What have the other doctor's told you about..."
  * NOT A QUIZ _"What is your understanding?"_

* STEP 3: Obtaining the Patient‚Äôs INVITATION

  * 10-20% of patients do not want to know prognosis
  * Family may be reluctant for patient to hear bad news

* STEP 4: Giving KNOWLEDGE and Information to the Patient
  * Warning shot
  * Pause
  * Use short sentences.
  * Make it non technical to the extent possible.
  * Use the words ‚Äì "Cancer," "AIDS," "Death" as appropriate
* STEP 5: Addressing the Patient‚Äôs EMOTIONS with empathic responses
  * Give them time to process the bad news. Don‚Äôt rush into the next steps
  * After giving this news, stay quiet for at least 10-15 seconds-resist the
    urge to tell the patient how to feel.
  * Allow them to assimilate the information
  * Use empathic statements (NURSE) 
* STEP 6: Strategy and Summary
  * Check for understanding
  * Summarize
  * Make clear plans for follow up.
  * Please write our instructions briefly and clearly and hand it to them
  * Give them guideline how about how best to get in touch with you/designee

### Pitfalls/Common Barriers to Good Communication \**

‚Ä¢ Giving pathophysiology lectures.

‚Ä¢ Ignoring the context of the communication encounter.

‚Ä¢ Not finding out the patient‚Äôs information needs.

‚Ä¢ Launching into your agenda first without negotiating the focus of
theninterview.

‚Ä¢ Offering reassurance prematurely.

### NURSE statements for articulating empathy

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Example</td>
    <td>Notes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Naming</td>
    <td>"It sounds like you are frustrated"</td>
    <td>In general, turn down the intensity a notch when you name the emotion</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Understanding</td>
    <td>‚ÄúThis helps me understand what you are thinking‚Äù</td>
    <td>Think of this as another kind of acknowledgment but stop short of suggesting you understand everything (you don‚Äôt)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Respecting</td>
    <td>‚ÄúI can see you have really been trying to follow our instructions‚Äù</td>
    <td>Remember that praise also fits in here eg ‚ÄúI think you have done a great job with this‚Äù</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Supporting</td>
    <td>‚ÄúI will do my best to make sure you have what you need‚Äù</td>
    <td>Making this kind of commitment is a powerful statement</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Exploring</td>
    <td>‚ÄúCould you say more about what you mean when you say that‚Ä¶‚Äù</td>
    <td>Asking a focused question prevents this from seeming too obvious</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Three fundamental skills

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Example</td>
    <td>Notes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tell me more</td>
    <td>"Tell me more about‚Ä¶"</td>
    <td>Use when you are not sure what someone is talking about (rather than jump to an assumption).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ask-tell-ask</td>
    <td>‚ÄúWhat do you think about‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what the tests show‚Äù
‚ÄúDoes that make sense‚Ä¶?‚Äù</td>
    <td>Related to Assess-Knowledge-Respond in SPIKES. Think of this as one unit of information transfer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>‚ÄúI wish‚Äù statements</td>
    <td>‚ÄúI wish I could say that the chemo always works‚Äù</td>
    <td>Enables you to align with the patient while acknowledging the reality of the situation</td>
  </tr>
</table>

2 COPING STYLES:

Psychologists have identified two main coping styles: monitors and blunters.
Patients who use problem-focused coping have been termed "monitors," who
typically seek information to help them manage. Monitors are very interested in
planning ahead, and are highly problem focused. In particular, monitors may find
that as their cancer progresses beyond the possibility of cure, they may hit a
wall in seeking information. With these patients, it may be helpful to limit or
contain their information seeking and gently shift them towards acknowledging
their emotions (NURSE). Patients who use emotion-focused coping are termed
‚Äúblunters,‚Äù who tend to cope by avoiding information, distancing themselves, and
engaging in denial of their situation. Blunters often avoid practical planning,
which almost ensures that others will be making decisions for them at the end of
their lives. With these patients, it may be necessary to contain their emotions
and shift them towards information and practical planning using ‚Äúask-tellask.‚Äù
Although these patients are said to be emotion-focused, they may not be ready to
go beyond denial with you until they have developed a very high level of trust.
It may be counterproductive to use NURSE repeatedly in the early stages of your
relationship with a blunter.
