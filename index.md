  Talking to a non-decision maker
    - Definitions
      -- Surrogate decision maker
      -- Health care proxy defined in living will, advance directives
      -- Power of attorney
          -- May be HCPOA
          -- May only be POA and limited to financial decisions
    - It’s not the oldest

  POA papers are typically prepared legally through a law office and may/may not include HC POA (must read to clarify)
   Living wills identify a healthcare proxy. If using the HH Advanced Directives packet, only 2 witnesses required, not notary.
   If we are recognizing, decision maker as HC POA or HC proxy, we should make every attempt to get paperwork on chart if not in Cerner.
   If letting NOK, act as medical surrogate, we should use the CERTIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE DECISION SURROGATE (PULSE page, forms) at least for compassionate extubation.
   If none of the above and no relatives, need case mgt to work on expedited guardianship. Guardianship (power over the person) vs. Conservatorship (power over the purse).

- Talking at people versus talking with people.
  -- We commonly come in and family say "you are the first people that is actually listen to me"
  -- Physicians typically feel their conversations are successful if they got all the information out there.
  -- Families and patients have a different criteria for a successful conversation, mostly where they heard.

- Brutal description of CPR
  -- "I know it is going to break ribs”
  -- Statistics are better as is explaining the condition after successful resuscitation.
  -- Do you ever remember somebody being better off, healthier after CPR?
  -- Again it comes down to what is the goal of doing CPR. What are we hoping to accomplish?
  -- Have you ever seen CPR on TV?

  -- You are trying to give them peace with their decision not peace with you

- Use empathic statements.

- Ignoring spiritual beliefs

- Not asking questions
  -- “What does everything mean?”
  -- “Tell me more about that?”
