The List of Woe

- Talking too much and not being quiet.
  -- Ask questions and don't talk all the time.
  -- What have they heard?
  -- What have they been thinking about?

- Assuming they care about what you would do with your family.
  -- It’s based on what they feel the patient would want.
  -- Decision made based on their values, goals, and beliefs not yours.
  -- Extreme informed consent

- Talking to a non-decision maker

  - Definitions [More](#Definitions)
    -- Surrogate decision maker
    -- Health care proxy defined in living will, advance directives
    -- Power of attorney
    -- May be HCPOA
    -- May only be POA and limited to financial decisions
  - It's not the uncle
  - It’s not the oldest child

- Beating a dead horse
  -- How long do you need to make a decision on your spouse, a new car, vacation?
  -- Give surrogates the same courtesy

- Making an agenda
  -- Being brutally honest is not a virtue.
  -- Do you like being told you are fat, bad haircut, etc?

- Thinking decisions are based on logic.

- Not listening to patient, family

- Blurring the line between level of care and CODE STATUS.

- Misunderstanding cognitive versus emotional understanding

- Talking at people versus talking with people.
  -- We commonly come in and family say "you are the first people that is actually listen to me"
  -- Physicians typically feel their conversations are successful if they got all the information out there.
  -- Families and patients have a different criteria for a successful conversation, mostly where they heard.

- Brutal description of CPR
  -- "I know it is going to break ribs”
  -- Statistics are better as is explaining the condition after successful resuscitation.
  -- Do you ever remember somebody being better off, healthier after CPR?
  -- Again it comes down to what is the goal of doing CPR. What are we hoping to accomplish?
  -- Have you ever seen CPR on TV?
  -- 1 in 6 survive to discharge, 1 and 20 survived without deficits.

- Do not argue, do not defend.
  -- Very common.
  -- People feel pressured to make a decision.

- Do not give bad news and expect an answer the same day.

- Respect patient autonomy and family choice even if it is not what you would do for your family member.
  -- This is hard.
  -- The goal is to decide what the patient would want in the situation.
  -- You are trying to give them peace with their decision not peace with you

- Use empathic statements.

- Ignoring spiritual beliefs

- Not asking questions
  -- “What does everything mean?”
  -- “Tell me more about that?”

  ### Use a talking map
  ## [REMAP](https://www.vitaltalk.org/guides/transitionsgoals-of-care/)
  1. Reframe why the status quo isn’t working. 
  2. Expect emotion & empathize. 
  3. Map the future.
  4. Align with the patient’s values. 
  5. Plan medical treatments that match patient values.

## Definitions

1. POA papers are typically prepared legally through a law office and may/may not include HC POA (must read to clarify)
2. Living wills identify a healthcare proxy. If using the HH Advanced Directives packet, only 2 witnesses required, not notary.
3. If we are recognizing, decision maker as HC POA or HC proxy, we should make every attempt to get paperwork on chart if not in Cerner.
4. If letting NOK, act as medical surrogate, we should use the CERTIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE DECISION SURROGATE (PULSE page, forms) at least for compassionate extubation.
5. If none of the above and no relatives, need case mgt to work on expedited guardianship. Guardianship (power over the person) vs. Conservatorship (power over the purse).
